# JavaScript for, while , do-while loops:

## Exercises-1👨‍💻:  

Get the sum of two arrays…actually the sum of all their elements.
P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

```
let arr_1 = [3, 5, 22, 5,  7,  2,  45, 75, 89, 21, 2];  // --> 276
let arr_2 = [9, 2, 42, 55, 71, 22, 4,  5,  90, 25, 26]; // --> 351
// Example output: 
// 276 + 351 = 627
```

## Exercises-2👨‍💻:

Using a for loop print all even numbers up to and including n. Don’t include 0.

```
let n1 = 22; 
// Example output: 
// 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 OR each item on a new line
```

## Exercises-3👨‍💻:

Using a for loop output the elements in reverse order


```
let arr = [43, "what", 9, true, "cannot", false, "be", 3, true];
// Example output: 
// true 3.5  be  false cannot  true 9 what 43 OR each item on a new line
```

## Exercises-4👨‍💻: (Optional)

Given two arrays of integers. Add up each element in the same position and
create a new array containing the sum of each pair. Assume both arrays are of the same length.

```
let arr_3   = [4, 6, 7];
let arr_4    = [8, 1, 9];
// Example output: 
// [12, 7, 16]
```

## Exercises-5👨‍💻:

Check if a string contains the letter “y”. Print “yes” if it does and “no” if it does not.

```
let str2 = "don’t know why";
// Example output: 
// “yes” 
```

## Exercises-6👨‍💻:

Given a number n Calculate the factorial of the number

```
let n2 = 4; //  4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
// Example output:
// 24
```

## Exercises-7👨‍💻:

Write a program that will check if two strings are palindromes. A palindrome is a word that spells the same forward and backward.
Palindrome: a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as
forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

```
let str3 = "racecar";
let str4 = "Java";
// Example output:
// string1 palindrome?: 
// Yes 
// string2 palindrome?: 
// No 
```

## Exercises-8👨‍💻:

Iterate through all numbers from 1 to 45. Print the following:
- For multiples of 3 print “Fizz”
- For multiples of 5 print “Buzz”
- For multiples of 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”

## Exercises-9👨‍💻:

Print all the elements of the following array(with for loop)

```
const thisIsAnArray = ["element1", "element2", "element3", "element4"];
```

## Exercises-10👨‍💻:

Print the EVEN numbers from 10 to -20

```
input: 10 and -20;
output: 10,8,6,4,2,0,-2,-4,-6,-8..
```
